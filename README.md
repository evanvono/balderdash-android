# balderdash-android

Welcome to my implementation of Balderdash for Android! This app is my attempt to replicate the popular word game, which I frequently play with my family. 

To play, at least two devices must be running the app, and one must host while the rest must join using the host's generated code. As of now, the game continues forever until the host quits. Scoring is handled as the game goes on.

To get words for this game, I utilize the Wordnik API.
